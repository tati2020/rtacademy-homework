                    While it has been a while since we've heard any substantial update on Bayonetta 3, Nintendo has confirmed that the game is "progressing well" despite its absence from E3 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking to GameSpot, Nintendo's Nate Bihldorff and Bill Trinen confirmed the game is still on its way and Trinen stated that the game is "progressing well."

                    "We like to show things when we're ready to show them. And certainly we like to show things when the developers are ready to show them," Trinen added. "We didn't have it here at E3, but stay tuned."

                    The Nintendo Switch-exclusive Bayonetta 3 was announced at The Game Awards 2017, but the game has stayed mostly quiet since then. Earlier this year, game director Hideki Kamiya said "it's safe to expect" news on the game in 2021.

                <p>
                    As reported by Kotaku, Kamiya took to Twitter to share his frustration with those on the internet who questioned if development has stopped or if the game has been delayed due to lack of updates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I get why people say, ‘Hurry up and release info’ or ‘Show us something,’ but...,” Kamiya wrote on Twitter. “Reckless remarks like ‘Has development stopped?’ or ‘I guess it’s been delayed’, etc. are nothing but annoying public waste.”
